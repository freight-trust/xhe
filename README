# XHE

### Overview
File or document headers have long been used to describe the information about a set of payloads in an entity that is kept separate and armâ€™s-length from the payloads themselves.

The metaphor of a paper envelope in which one places business documents for transport or management is apt to describe the role of an exchange header envelope in a container relationship to its payloads. Concepts of routing, authentication, non-repudiation and concealment all apply in both the metaphor and the electronic equivalent.

### What is an Exchange Header Envelope?
The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) specifies an XML vocabulary [XML] expressing in machine-processable syntax the semantics of describing either a header to or an envelope of a set of payloads of content with information about that content. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01 [CCTS 2.01].

XHE, a specification developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS, is the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 [SBDH] and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) version 1.1 [BDE].

#### Note regarding publications
The UN/CEFACT Exchange Header Envelope and the OASIS Exchange Header Envelope are the same specification developed in collaboration and published as standards by the two organizations following the practices of each.
